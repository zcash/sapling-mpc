This document is a guide to participate in Multi-party Computation(MPC) phase 2 and verify the result.

## What should I do ? 

1. Send an application email to tronz_mpc@tronz.io in order to participate in MPC. Please introduce yourself in the email and tell us your available time. For example:
    ```    
    Hi Tronz,
     
      I'm Brown Jiang, applying to participate in the MPC project. My available time is 2020-01-20 ~ 2020-01-22, 08:00~10:00, UTC+8. As a student of Peking University, I'm living in Beijing China now, focusing on Blockchain technology.
     
    Yours Faithfully,
    Brown Jiang
    ```    
2. TRONZ will send you an email about the time for you to participate in MPC.

3. When it is your turn, TRONZ will send you a notification email and give you a params file link which you will need to download. 

4. Download and install IM tool [keybase](https://keybase.io/). If you don't have an account yet, create an account and add TRONZ's account as your friend. TRONZ's account is `tronz_mpc`.

5. Prepare your server. Recommended server requirements:
      + Processor (CPU): Intel Core i5 (sixth generation or newer) or equivalent
      + Operating System: Linux (Recommended) / macOS / Windows 7+         
      + Memory: 8 GB RAM
      + Storage: 4 GB free Disk storage
      
&emsp;&emsp;On Windows, please go to [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) homepage for installation instruction, then install [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126); at last, jump to next step.

&emsp;&emsp;On Mac, install xcode command line tools first:
```
# xcode-select --install
```
&emsp;&emsp;On Mac/Linux, Run the following code in your terminal to download Rustup and install Rust, then follow the instructions if you are running on macOS / Linux / another Unix-like OS:
```
# curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
and choose 1 when prompted. After installation, run:
```
# source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

6. Obtain the source code of project `mpc`:
```
# git clone https://github.com/tronprotocol/mpc
```
&emsp;&emsp;If git has not been installed on your computer, please download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) first.

7. In the `mpc` directory, download `params` file, then run:
```
# cargo run --release --bin compute
```

&emsp;&emsp;When itâ€™s finished, you will get a `new_params` file and a `hash` which you must need to record. You can find the `hash` and `new_params` as shown below:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tronprotocol/documentation-en/master/docs_without_index/internal-test/mpc-output.jpg)

&emsp;&emsp;Notice: this process could take 0.5 ~ 1 hours depending on your hardware capacity and occupy 1.5 ~ 2GB of memory.

8. Send your result to TRONZ. Please send the file `new_params` by keybase; send `hash` string by email, feel free to state your os version in email, E.g. windows 7/centos 7.

## Dependency
We reuse the phase 2 result of zcash https://download.z.cash/sapling-mpc/params as the first `params` of the process. In the end of the process, we generate a random beacon by using one Bitcoin block's hash as the seed of pseudo random number generator. The block's height will not be determined until the last participant completes his operation. After we've verified all participants' contributions, we will publish all the hashes on project [wiki](https://github.com/tronprotocol/mpc/wiki) page.

## How to verify my contribution ?

After all participants have finished the process, we will announce the final params at AWS. Anyone can verify their contribution as below :
```
# cd mpc
# wget https://mpcfilepub.s3.amazonaws.com/mpc/params
# wget https://mpcfilepub.s3.amazonaws.com/powersoftau/powersoftau_phase1_files.tar
# tar xvf powersoftau_phase1_files.tar && cp powersoftau_phase1_files/* .
# cargo run --release --features="verification" --bin verify
```
This verification may take about 1 hour to output all participants' contributions. Find whether your hash is on the list.
